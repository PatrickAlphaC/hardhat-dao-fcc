# DAO voting can be done in 3 major ways:

1. Token Bases Voting-

   - It's the most simplest way, the more token you have the more voting power you'll get.

   Problem;

   - Not a Good way, Becoz Rich people will benefit from this.

2. Skin in the Game Voting-

   - In this method, every vote is mapped to their voter, and If someone try to make bad decision for whatever. His/Her voting power will taken from them.

   Problem;

   - How will you tell if some decision Bad or not.

3. Proof of PersonHood or Participation-

   - This is the most perfect and hardest way, Each voter will have 1 vote, No matter how many wallets they have.

   Problem;

   - How you can tell if someone have multiple wallets or not. Becoz you don't have their identity.

   Solution;

   - Not available yet, But It can be solved with Chainlink somehow.

# Types of Voting by environment:

1. ON-chain voting: (ex- Compound)

   PROS;

   - Transparent, Decentralized, Structure will be easy.

   CONS;

   - You charging 1 million dollar to your community for one change.

   * 10000 people => $100/vote(gas) => $1Million/newChange

<br>
2. OFF-chain voting: (ex: Snapshot {but he does not use chainlink decentralized orcale})

- It will be decentralized don't worry.

- Voter can sign their vote with their voter signature and instead of throughing On-chain, you can just send it to services like IPFS.

- And then gather the result of that data and then send it to On-chain in one go via orcale like-chainlink to save the Gas.

You have the chance to build something like sanpshot but more decentralized.
